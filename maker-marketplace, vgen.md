Creators POV on VGen, Artistree (for print/visual art)
https://www.reddit.com/r/artbusiness/comments/1bir19p/artistree_pros_and_cons/
- invoice and queue management
	- artistree has public queue https://artistree.io/queue/byorone
- artistree no 5% fee?
- still need to bring traffic from outside for most of these sites
- sketchmob, fiverr (20% cut!) bad rep

https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/16ae426/why_do_artists_use_vgen/
- people complain about only 5% cut
- VGen UI is good for artists
- VGen has protections
	- for clients 
		- guaranteed delivery date with full refund
		- verified artists
	- for artists, profile page, portfolio, showcase done commissions
- Becoming verified "takes 10 followers, earning 100usd, reviews from 3 different clients and for your artist rating to be 4.6 or more"
- VGen limited to offering 5 service types - some artists have more

GenAI very unpopular with artists. So is copying style
- if genai is trained on artist work, would be impopular, even if can recommend similar artists
