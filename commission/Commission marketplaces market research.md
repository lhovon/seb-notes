Forums such as SuperFuture (fashion), WatchUSeek (horology), and Therpf (replica prop forum) served as the primary venues for custom work.

## Some Notes


None of these have an embedded community aspect. Vgen etc embed themselves in existing communities but they are not the main hub for them. 

Maybe with moodboard sharing and a forum/reddit message board we could create community

### Fashion moodboard sharing - Polyvore

## How is IP managed on those platforms?

How does IP work in these platforms? Who owns the blueprint? The customer, platform or artist? Is it important for artists? 
- designs are a collaboration between customer, creator possibly third-party drafter
- VGen innovation of tiered checkout feea for personal vs commercial merchandising rights
Art standard is maker maintains ip rights, customer owns physical impl and has a personal use license (implicit)

Industrial standard of work made for hire
- product is a cad file meant for manufacture
- Full ip transfer to buyer (ip assignment policy by cadcrowd)
- see cadcrowd, xometry, fictiv

Royalty/crowdsourced model
- creator retains copyright, grants platform perpetual esclusive license to specific verticals (like minted with prints) so able to exploit others elsewhere
- see minted, threadless

Quirky was a failure of shared ownership. Filed patents of crowdsourced inventions

Vgen licensing as a feature, monetize it

Who would want to hide the products from the platform?
- customers likely more than makers since it’s free publicity for them. Similarly platform wants to show all completed products and the whole process. Platform can compile a dataset of input to digital IR. 
- In addition to ip ownership, customer can purchase away the platforms right to display product




Failures
- keebswab vs /r/mechmarket
- custommade did RFQs, maker paid subscription 



## Jewelry

Custommade did RFQs (reverse auctions)
- high CAC cost low LTV (infrequent purchases)
- Project posted to completed rate was low
- Makers spent hours doing rfqs and askers were insulted by high quoted prices (wrong expectations)
- Operational complexity of dispute mediation. Highly subjective “too red”
Pivoted to the jewelry vertical
Vertical means it captures the retail margin vs marketplace fee
- has cad designers work for them behind the scenes 
- Chat interface where you critique, go multiple rounds and approve


Etsy custom order starts a chat but treated as an SKU
- no milestone payments, approval stages, contracts
- purchase prtection biased towards buyer - creator bore full cost since cant liquidate custom items

Gemvara 
- blank page problem solved by parametric customization
- Negative working capital, get paid before manufacturing is holy grail of retail
- richline group acquired gemvara prinarily for software platform - visualization was a core moat

I coincidentally have used CustomMade to make a ring. The whole UI is basically a chat with your 'consultant' who guides you through the process. My friend designed the ring by uploading images, they sent back pictures of 3d renders (never the actual 3d file) and there was back and forth for a few months. 
For me, I could refer back to the design and provide my measuremnts, etc. I was asked about which options I wanted, I kept having to tell them I wanted the same as my reference order did.

They shipped it with their preferred shipper (UPS, I couldnt choose) and I had a lot of trouble receiving the package - I ended having to pay about 50% extra in duties after Trump tariffs, directly from UPS. 

## Furniture

Wescover - leader for furniture 
, which are heavy expensive and consumers rarely purchase them. 
Focus on b2b instead where buyers control logistics

Tearsheet in interior design https://chairish.live/dh-community/importance-of-tearsheets-in-design-schematic
In context discovery engine
- digital clone of person?
- offers tools to interior designers


Challenges of shipping 
Furniture needs freight LTL (less than truckload), hard to quote accurately ahead of time + exact item dimensions same thing!!
- paintings, fabrics ok on this front
Integration of digital freight networks to buy  “futures” for freight and reduce variance

## Fashion

Coscove - commission cosplay costumes
- apparently had lots of ghosting by makers, solved by escrow, financial layer is one of value props
- What do they mean by “supports the secondhand market” ??

Digital measurements profile
Remote fitting with cheap toile

Shoes of prey failure
- tried to manufacture them but needed too much different tooling
- Blank canvas problem

Forums such as SuperFuture (fashion), WatchUSeek (horology), and Therpf (replica prop forum) served as the primary venues for custom work.

for high-passion niches, community integration is more important than transactional efficiency.
