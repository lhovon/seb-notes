## **Questions**
- Is MTO always luxury?
- They mention using OSS what is it?

NJAL is a **luxury** indie designer marketplace - offers a platform for up and coming designers to sell **globally**
**50% of our sales come from the US, and roughly 35% from the EU**
(rest in Middle East apparently)40% of our sales are for items that are bespoke and tailor-made for our customers.
Sellers pay for shipping and handle it themselves. Must have tracking number.
We highly recommend to ensure you have a business account with a major carrier such as UPS, FedEx or DHL as they can provide rates at up to 70% discount
Payment
NJAL works with valid PayPal account to automate all payments.Should PayPal not be available in your country we ask that you open a foreign bank account, or work with an intermediary or a friend in a country where PayPal is available. We can no longer make exceptions and accept invoices and pay via wire transfers.
- is Stripe better?
Detected shopify and Drupal on their platform.

### **Shipping**
All orders are shipped free of charge to the customer, so shipping costs must be factored into your product prices.
**Industry standard for luxury e-commerce is to provide free shipping**, which means our customers will not be charged extra for shipping. This means you have to incorporate shipping costs into your prices. **Since 50% of our sales come from the US, and roughly 35% from the EU** you can estimate these costs in advance. We highly recommend to ensure you have a business account with a major carrier such as UPS, FedEx or DHL as they can provide rates at up to 70% discount. Alternatively, use a third-party retailer for such carriers to ensure you never have to pay retail prices.
We do not allow the use of standard postal services, especially if a tracking number cannot be provided.
If you are based in a region where shipping costs to our main markets are too high, we recommend working with a fulfillment warehouse that will dispatch your designs for you and handle all your logistics. NJAL works closely with [CCS](https://www.ccs-express.de/), and you can contact them stating you are a NJAL designer.
