- During our first two years of business, paid social marketing was the most effective for boosting brand awareness and customer acquisition. However, our marketing focus has evolved to growing acquisition and retention via non-paid marketing channels. Our most successful strategy to increase the current conversion rate for non-paid channels is via strategic partnerships outside of traditional fashion relationships, with businesses whose existing customer base aligns with ours but does not compete in any way
- Returns for an online platform is one of the biggest pain points and margin killers. When we think about Cult Mia specifically, we work with independent and emerging designers who face scaling and localisation challenges as small businesses
- I am particularly proud of our 95% brand retention rate and 80% brand onboarding success rate, showing us the brands that we handpick to join Cult Mia have wanted to stay onboard throughout our growth journey.
- This month, we’re launching an Incubator that will offer a range of B2B services, ranging from digital marketing to data analytics to allow the brands that we work with to have the knowledge and resources to scale effectively and sustainably alongside Cult Mia

- The two profit levers for Cult Mia are commission on sales and shipping costs, from which derive gross margin. As of today, more than 30% of Cult Mia’s brand partners cover shipping costs to customers. The average shipping cost globally for Cult Mia is £15. 2020’s average gross margin was 48%, over 120% above industry average for a marketplace model, the company says.
- The discovery process is driven by Cult Mia’s network of brand sourcing partners, spanning across influencers, **fashion universities**, stylists, PR agencies and local fashion authorities
- The platform’s business model is very agile and starts with a data-driven curation. It listens to its community and is constantly testing trends, products, collections and brands that Cult Mia is vetting on social media. The curation and demand planning is driven by Cult Mia’s community insights and feedback. The platform is currently rolling out data-driven influencer partnerships as part of the brand-sourcing process. Influencers will vet upcoming brands with their communities, whose following is aligned with Cult Mia’s target customer in terms of values and demographics.
- Learning from 2020’s sales and testing of 14 different categories, we will focus on clothing, followed by jewellery and bags.
- The platform wants to expand on its partner services offering by starting to financially invest and back the brands in which we see potential.
