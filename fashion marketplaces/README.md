Some research into currently operating fashion marketplaces

Etsy is the obvious, but it for all arts and crafts.

NJAL is the best 'high fashion' marketplace for independent designers. IMO their business model genius is the 'industry' plan to give businesses access to their creators for special projects, learning market trends, and more.

Cult mia is a more standard independent creator fashion marketplace. They have some MTO products. Very social media driven, CEO is a business woman

Other honorable mention

- founded by Ying Suen and Jules Volleberg in 2020, takes **35 per cent commission** from a garment’s retail price, and the rest goes back to the designer. “You can join our platform if you have a few designs and don’t need stock as we also work on a made-to-order basis,” Volleberg says. “We have worked with several students and are regularly a brand’s first stockist. Our model essentially removes significant financial risk for the brands, allowing them to start small and grow slowly if the demand is there.”
- “Retailers and brands need to focus on knowing their shoppers, **having the right product and profitability**, to win together, to support brand equity and grow brands,” she says. “Social commerce, gamification, storytelling and in-store experiences that wow shoppers are important today. There is no one right model. It depends on the brand, its consumers, and the addressable market.”
